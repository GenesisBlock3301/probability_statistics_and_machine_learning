## Learning Roadmap of Probability and Statistics

### Statistics roadmap for ML:
Probability theory:
- Probability
- Random variables
- Probability distributions
- Conditional probability is crucial for modeling uncertainty in ML.

Descriptive statistics:
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation)

Inferential statistics:
- Hypothesis testing
- Confidence intervals
- P-values are essential for making inferences and drawing conclusions from data samples.

Regression analysis:
- Linear regression and its variants are widely used in ML for modeling relationships between variables and making predictions.

Probability distributions:
- Gaussian (normal) distribution
- Binomial distribution
- Poisson's distribution is beneficial for understanding the behavior of data and modeling assumptions.

Sampling techniques:
- Understanding different sampling techniques, such as random sampling and stratified sampling, is important for collecting representative training and test datasets.

Statistical hypothesis testing:
- Knowing how to perform hypothesis tests, interpret the results
- Make decisions based on statistical significance is crucial for evaluating ML models.

Statistical modeling: Knowledge of techniques like
- maximum likelihood estimation (MLE),
- Bayesian inference can be helpful for parameter estimation and building probabilistic models.

Experimental design:
- Understanding principles of experimental design, such as randomization,
  control groups, and factorial designs, helps in conducting rigorous experiments and A/B testing in ML.

Multivariate statistics:
- Techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis
- Cluster analysis provide tools for dimensionality reduction, feature selection
- Pattern recognition in high-dimensional datasets.
