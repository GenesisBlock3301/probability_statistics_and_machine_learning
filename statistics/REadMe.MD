## Statistics
``` Statistics is a science of collecting, organizing, presenting, analysing and interpreting data to
 help making more effective decisions.
 ```

**Statistical methods can be used to find answers to the questions
like:**
- What kind and how much data need to be collected?
- How should we organize and summarize the data?
- How can we analyse the data and draw conclusions from it?
- How can we assess the strength of the conclusions and evaluate their
uncertainty.

### Types of statistical applications:

**Descriptive Statistics**[sklearn](..%2Fsklearn) is the branch of statistics that deals with summarizing, organizing, and presenting data in a
meaningful way. The goal of descriptive statistics is to describe the main features of a dataset, such as the mean, 
median, mode, and spread of the data. For example, if we want to describe the height of all students in a class, 
we might calculate the average height and the range (difference between the shortest and tallest students).

**Inferential Statistics** on the other hand, is concerned with making predictions or inferences about a larger population
based on a sample of data. The goal of inferential statistics is to estimate the population parameters from the sample
statistics. For example, if we want to estimate the average height of all students in a school based on the heights of
a sample of 50 students, we would use inferential statistics to make this prediction. Inferential statistics allows us
to make generalizations about a population based on a sample, which can be useful in situations where collecting data
from the entire population is either too time-consuming or too expensive.

### Population
A set of all values or elements defined on some common characteristics is called a population. If we want to study on 
student weight of class Xii, all student's weights are population

## **Data**
Any observation that have been collected is called data.

**Classification of data:**
- Quantitative (Countable data) -> 1,2,3,4
- Qualitative data (Uncountable data or Categorical) -> Good, Better, Best, Female, Male etc.

**Descriptive statistics:** Descriptive statistics consist of meth-ods for organizing and summarizing information, 
such as the mean, median, mode, and spread of the data. For example, if we want to describe the height of all students
in a class, we might calculate the average height and the range (difference between the shortest and tallest students).

**Inferential statistics:** on the other hand, is concerned with making predictions or inferences about a larger 
population based on a sample of data. The goal of inferential statistics is to estimate the population parameters 
from the sample statistics. For example, if we want to estimate the average height of all students in a school based on 
the heights of a sample of 50 students, we would use inferential statistics to make this prediction. Inferential 
statistics allows us to make generalizations about a population based on a sample, which can be useful in situations 
where collecting data from the entire population is either too time-consuming or too expensive.


**Descriptive and Inferential Statistics**
The dice is rolled 100 times, and the result are forming the sample data. Descriptive data is used to grouping the sample
data to following table:

| Outcome of the roll | Frequency |
|---------------------|-----------|
| 1                   | 10        |
| 2                   | 20        |
| 3                   | 18        |
| 4                   | 16        |
| 5                   | 11        |
| 6                   | 25        |

In that case Inferential statistics can now be used to verify whether the dice is a fair or not.
Descriptive and inferential statistics are interrelated. 

**What is Parameter in Statistics?**

A parameter in statistics is a numerical value that describes a characteristic of a population. Parameters are used to
describe population features such as the mean, standard deviation, proportion, or regression coefficient. 
They are usually represented by Greek letters such as μ (mean), σ (standard deviation), π (proportion), or β (regression
coefficient).
For example, let's consider the population of heights of adult males in a particular city. 
- The mean height of the 
population, μ, is a parameter that describes the average height of all adult males in the city. 
- The standard deviation, σ, is another parameter that describes how much the heights of the adult males in the city 
deviate from the mean height.
Another example is a population of customers who bought a particular product. The proportion of customers who are 
satisfied with the product, π, is a parameter that describes the ratio of satisfied customers to the total number of 
customers in the population.
In conclusion, parameters are numerical values that describe population characteristics, and they are usually estimated 
from sample data in order to make inferences about the population.

## Data Analysis
- Uni-variant -> PDF, CDF
- Bivariant -> Pair Plot, Scatter Plot
- Multi-variant -> 3D Plot

## Statistical Data analysis:
Statistical analysis should contain following step:

1. Formulate the research problem.
2. Define population and sample.
3. Collect the data.
4. Do descriptive data analysis.
5. Use appropriate statistical methods to solve the research problem.
6. Report the result.

## Variable
A characteristic that varies from one person or thing to another is called a
variable, i.e, a variable is any characteristic that varies from one individual
member of the population to another. Examples of variables for humans are
height, weight, number of siblings, sex, marital status, and eye color. The
first three of these variables yield numerical information (yield numerical
measurements) and are examples of quantitative (or numerical) variables,
last three yield non-numerical information (yield non-numerical measurements)
and are examples of qualitative (or categorical) variables.
Quantitative variables can be classified as either discrete or continuous.

## Organization Of the Data:
Observing the values of the variables for one or more people or things yield data. Each individual piece of data is 
called an observation and the collection of all observation is called data set or data matrix.


## Qualitative Variable:
The number of observation that fall into particular class or category of the qualitative variable is called frequency of
that class or category.

The Qualitative data represented by pie chart or bar graph.
