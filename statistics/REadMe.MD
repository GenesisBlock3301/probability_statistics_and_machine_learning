## Statistics
` Statistics is a science of collecting, organizing, presenting, analysing and interpreting data to
 help making more effective decisions.`

### Types of statistical applications:

**Descriptive Statistics**[sklearn](..%2Fsklearn) is the branch of statistics that deals with summarizing, organizing, and presenting data in a
meaningful way. The goal of descriptive statistics is to describe the main features of a dataset, such as the mean, 
median, mode, and spread of the data. For example, if we want to describe the height of all students in a class, 
we might calculate the average height and the range (difference between the shortest and tallest students).

**Inferential Statistics** on the other hand, is concerned with making predictions or inferences about a larger population
based on a sample of data. The goal of inferential statistics is to estimate the population parameters from the sample
statistics. For example, if we want to estimate the average height of all students in a school based on the heights of
a sample of 50 students, we would use inferential statistics to make this prediction. Inferential statistics allows us
to make generalizations about a population based on a sample, which can be useful in situations where collecting data
from the entire population is either too time-consuming or too expensive.

### Population
A set of all values or elements defined on some common characteristics is called a population. If we want to study on 
student weight of class Xii, all student's weights are population

### 


## **Data**
Any observation that have been collected is called data.

**Classification of data:**
- Quantitative (Countable data) -> 1,2,3,4
- Qualitative data (Uncountable data) -> Good, Better, Best, Female, Male etc

**Frequency:**
The number of time an observation occurs is called frequency.

Example 1: 1st tutorial mark of students:


|         |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| student | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10|
| marks   | 3 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 7 | 3 | 7 | 5 | 9 | 5 |

## **Frequency of dataset items :**

| Mark      | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| 3         | 2         |
| 5         | 4         |
| 2         | 1         |
| 7         | 2         |
| 9         | 1         |
| **total** | **+-10**  |

## Data Analysis
- Uni-variant -> PDF, CDF
- Bivariant -> Pair Plot, Scatter Plot
- Multi-variant -> 3D Plot
