### **What is Standard Deviation?**  
Standard deviation (SD) is a measure of how **spread out** the numbers are in a dataset. A **low SD** means the values 
are **close to the mean**, while a **high SD** means the values are **more spread out**.

### **Real-Life Examples:**
#### **1. Student Exam Scores**
- Imagine a math test where students score the following:
  - **Class A:** [85, 87, 86, 88, 84] → **Low SD** (scores are close together)
  - **Class B:** [60, 90, 75, 40, 100] → **High SD** (scores vary a lot)

  **Interpretation:**  
  - **Class A has consistent performance** because the scores are close to the average.
  - **Class B has varied performance**, meaning some students did very well while others struggled.

#### **2. Temperature in Two Cities**
- **City 1:** [28°C, 30°C, 29°C, 31°C, 30°C] → **Low SD** (temperatures are stable)
- **City 2:** [10°C, 35°C, 20°C, 40°C, 5°C] → **High SD** (temperatures fluctuate a lot)

  **Interpretation:**  
  - City 1 has **consistent** weather, so people can dress similarly every day.
  - City 2 has **high variation**, so people need to prepare for sudden temperature changes.

#### **3. Employee Salaries in Two Companies**
- **Company A:** Salaries are **$48,000, $50,000, $52,000, $49,000, $51,000** → **Low SD** (salaries are similar)
- **Company B:** Salaries are **$30,000, $150,000, $50,000, $200,000, $25,000** → **High SD** (big salary gaps)

  **Interpretation:**  
  - Company A has **equal pay distribution**.
  - Company B has **a huge gap between high and low salaries**, meaning pay is **unequal**.
